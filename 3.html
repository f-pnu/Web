    JavaScript
  </h3>
  <p>
    JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6] often abbreviated as JS, is a
    programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
    JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and
    multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing,
    prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of
    the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is
    an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites
    use it for client-side page behavior,[9] and all major web browsers have
    a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

    As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven,
    functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application
    programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular
    expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model
    (DOM). However, the language itself does not include any input/output
    (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, as the host
    environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.

    JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they
    are now embedded in some servers, usually via Node.js. They are also
    embedded in a variety of applications created with frameworks such as
    Electron and Cordova. Although there are similarities between JavaScript
    and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard
    libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
